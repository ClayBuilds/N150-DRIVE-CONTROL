This code reads inputs from a PS2 controller and uses it to control 3 brushed DC motor drivers on a robot, a Nomadic Technologies N150.

I ran this code on a Teensy 4.0, but it would function on any arduino compatible microcontroller with an SPI port and sufficient PWM capable pins. 3v3 logic level is recommended for the PS2 controller.
